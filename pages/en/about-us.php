<h1>About us</h1>
<p>The Open Meteo Foundation (OMetFn) is a non-profit organization founded in 2012 and dedicated to promote open data, open knowledge and open science in the field of meteorology.</p>
<p>Born as <a title="Opening the Weather" href="http://blog.openmeteofoundation.org/2013/07/opening-weather.html" target="_blank">a personal attempt to get better weather info for paragliding</a>, the project grown since we realized there are bigger issues at stake.</p>
<p>Thanks to great support from the initial free-flying community and <a title="Partners and Funders" href="/partners">our partners</a> we built foundation for a strong venture and demonstrated the need for open meteorological data. Now we are ready for action.</p>
<h2>Our vision</h2>
<p>National weather services and private companies have done great work for more than a century to make better use of our meteorological knowledge. However, large gains are still to be made.</p>
<p>We believe making citizen, developers and academics stand together will push meteorology forward in the society, leading to new innovation and great improvements of everybody&#8217;s life. Weather is the key for safer and more sustainable societies.</p>
<p>We know that enthusiasts joined by one idea could achieve more than large companies or public  agencies. Community-driven projects in cases like Linux, Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap shown us the way.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Open Meteo Foundation aims to support the global open meteorology community, being a home for projects of all kinds, investigating and exploring topics and innovation around weather.</p>
<p>Legacy OMetFn activity was to run high-res forecasts for the France and Alps regions.</p>
<p>From here we want to move forward with new projects including :</p>
<ul>
<li>provide high-res forecasts for whole Europe (at first)</li>
<li>bring easy access to worldwide data</li>
<li>creating a &#8220;weather data for the dumb&#8221; knowledge base</li>
<li>engineering large-scale amateur stations networks</li>
<li>act as a catalyst in the opendata political debate</li>
</ul>
